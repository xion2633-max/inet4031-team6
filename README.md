# INET 4031: Team [number] Repository

This is the semester-long repository for our team's INET 4031 Systems Administration
project: an incident-tracking application built and operated across nine weeks,
moving from Docker Compose through Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD,
observability, security hardening, and backup/recovery.

**The full in-depth lab instructions for every week are in the "Wiki" tab of each week's lab repository.**

## Getting Each Week's Starter Content

Starting Week 2, each week has a corresponding `inet4031-week0N` repo with starter
and reference files for that week. You pull only what you need from it into this one
repo, it will never replace this repository.
